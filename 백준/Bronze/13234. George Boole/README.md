### 문제 설명

<p>George Boole was an English mathematician, educator, philosopher who was born in 1815, 200 years ago. He was the first professor of mathematics at Queen&#39;s College, Cork (now University College Cork (UCC)) and is known as the inventor of boolean arithmetic: The field that is the basis of today&rsquo;s computers.</p>

<p>In boolean arithmetic, instead of infinite numbers we only have 2 values: 0/1, true/false, yes/no, etc. We will use the values true and false in this problem. The two most common operations in boolean arithmetic are AND and OR.</p>

<p>The result of an AND operation is true only if both elements are true. Examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>true AND true = true</li>
	<li>true AND false = false</li>
	<li>false AND false = false</li>
</ul>

<p>The result of an OR operation is true if any of the elements are true. Examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>true OR true = true</li>
	<li>false OR false = false</li>
	<li>false OR true = true&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>In this problem you&rsquo;ll read one of such operations and write the correct result.</p>

### 입력

<p>Read a single line from the standard input. The line will contain three words with the format:</p>

<p>value1 operation value2. The fields value1 and value2 will be either true or false. The field operation will be either AND or OR.</p>

### 출력

<p>Print either true or false.</p>
