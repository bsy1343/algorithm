### 문제 설명

<p>Inspired by the Ulam spiral, which unravels strange patterns of prime numbers&#39; distribution, Petya decided to come up with his own analog.</p>

<p>Petya writes down integers from $1$ to $n^2$ into square table of size $n\times n$ starting from the upper left corner. Numbers from $1$ to $n$ go into the first row, numbers from $n + 1$ to $2n$  --- into the second row, and so on.</p>

<p>Then he colors cells which contain the number with no more than $k$ different divisors. After that, Petya studies the resulting picture in hope of finding some patterns. For example, if $n = 7$, $k = 3$, Petya will get the following picture:</p>

<p>Help Petya, print the picture which he will get after coloring, representing colored cells with asterisks &lt;&lt;<code>*</code>&gt;&gt;, and non-colored cells with dots &lt;&lt;<code>.</code>&gt;&gt;.</p>

### 입력

<p>Input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 40$, $1 \le k \le n^2$).</p>

### 출력

<p>Output $n$ lines, each one containing $n$ characters. If the $j$-th cell of $i$-th row of Petya&#39;s table is colored, then $j$-th character of $i$-th line should be equal to &lt;&lt;<code>*</code>&gt;&gt;, and &lt;&lt;<code>.</code>&gt;&gt; otherwise.</p>
