### 문제 설명

<p>As part of the import phaseout government plan in you-know-what country, a game called &quot;Karmon go&quot; was released; the game mechanics is based around karaoke monsters, the Karmons. Among other things, each karmon in the game has a battle power parameter  --- the BP. BP can be increased by two means: by <em>powering up</em> the karmon and by <em>evolving</em> it into another karmon species. When a karmon is powered up, a certain constant is added to its BP, which depends only on the species of the karmon. When a karmon evolves, BP is multiplied by a certain factor, depending only on the species of the karmon into which it evolves. A karmon can be evolved only once, and can be powered up only a limited number of times. The player must use both methods of increasing his karmon&#39;s BP, but he&#39;s free to choose the order: to power up and then to evolve, or vice versa. The resulting BP depends on the chosen order.</p>

<p>Consider the following example: let a player have a Bichu karmon with a BP of $7$. Powering up Bichu raises its BP by $5$. Bichu can be evolved into Bikachu, multiplying its BP by $1.6$. Powering up Bikachu raises its BP by $7$. Let a player, for example, power his karmon up $3$ times. First powering Bichu up and then evolving it results in a BP of $(7 + 3 \cdot 5) \cdot 1.6 = 35.2$. On the other hand, first evolving Bichu into Bikachu and subsequently powering it up brings its BP to $7 \cdot 1.6 + 3 \cdot 7 = 32.2$. It turns out that in the current example powering up followed by evolving is more advantageous.</p>

<p>Help our rookie players figure out the best strategy to develop their karmons: powering up then evolving or vice versa.</p>

### 입력

<p>The input file consists of a single line describing a karmon&#39;s features and its evolution in the following format: $name_0$ $inc_0$ $name_1$ $mul_1$ $inc_1$, </p>

<ul>
	<li>$name_0$  --- karmon name.</li>
	<li>$inc_0$  --- integer constant added to the karmon&#39;s BP when powered up prior to evolution ($1 \leq inc_0 \leq 10^6$).</li>
	<li>$name_1$  --- karmon name after evolution.</li>
	<li>$mul_1$  --- real number factor, by which the karmon&#39;s BP is multiplied after evolution ($1 \leq mul_1 \leq 100$). The number contains no more than five decimal digits after decimal point.</li>
	<li>$inc_1$  --- integer constant added to the karmon&#39;s BP when powered up after evolution ($1 \leq inc_1 \leq 10^6$).</li>
</ul>

<p>The name of any karmon can contain only Latin characters in upper and lower case. The length of the name should be no less than one and no longer than a hundred characters.</p>

### 출력

<p>The output file must contain the line &quot;Power up, Evolve&quot; or the line &quot;Evolve, Power up&quot; depending on which way of developing the karmon is more advantageous to achieve the highest BP: first power up and then evolve, or the opposite, respectively. If the order of powering up and evolution makes no difference, print the word &quot;Whatever&quot;.</p>
