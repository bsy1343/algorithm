### 문제 설명

<p>A guy named Gry found a new game called &quot;Mini-Tetris 3023&quot;. This small version of Tetris is played on a very long grid only $2$ cells high and has just three types of tile:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <code>square</code> made out of $4$ tiles in a $2 \times 2$ grid.</li>
	<li>An <code>S-tile</code> made out of $4$ tiles, $2$ on one row and $2$ slightly offset on the other</li>
	<li>A <code>corner</code> made out of $3$ tiles, $1$ on one row and $2$ on the other</li>
</ul>

<p>Tiles may be rotated $0$, $90$, $180$, or $270$ degrees to fit amongst each other, however, they cannot overlap or go outside the vertical boundary of the grid.</p>

<p>This game provides $a$ squares, $b$ S-tiles, and $c$ corners. Gry would like to beat the high score by creating the largest-possible contiguous $2 \times n$ rectangle out of some or all of the provided tiles, without any tiles overlapping or sticking out of the rectangle.</p>

### 입력

<ul>
	<li>The sole line of input contains three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ ($0 \leq a, b, c \leq 50$) --- the number of squares, S-tiles, and corners, respectively.</li>
</ul>

### 출력

<p>Output the maximum possible width of the grid, $n$, that can be perfectly filled by some or all of the given tiles without overlapping or overstepping the boundaries.</p>
