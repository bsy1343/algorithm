### 문제 설명

<p>After you helped to save last year's Tic-Tac-Toe World Championships, you were given a grant to write a new tic-tac-toe AI to determine the best move to play.</p>

<p>A Tic-Tac-Toe board looks like the following. Every square can be empty, filled with an <code>X</code>, or filled with a <code>O</code> (capital letter 'o').</p>

<p>Player <code>X</code> has won if they have three <code>X</code>'s in a row. Player <code>O</code> wins if they can do the same with the <code>O</code>'s. A row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.</p>

<p>Given the player whose turn it is, and a board where there is one winning move for that player, can you output the row and column where that player should play?</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line of the input is either <code>X</code> or <code>O</code>, representing the player whose turn it is.</p>

<p>The next three lines each have $3$ characters. Each of these lines represents a row on the board. Each character in a line represents a square in that row. This means you have $3$ rows and $3$ columns just like a normal Tic-Tac-Toe board.</p>

<p>Each square in the board contains either an <code>X</code>, <code>O</code> (that's a capital letter, not a number), or <code>E</code>. An <code>X</code> or <code>O</code> represents markings made by the players while <code>E</code> represents an empty square.</p>

<p>Input Restrictions</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is guaranteed that there will be one and only one square that will win the game for the player specified on the first line.</li>
	<li>The input may not necessarily represent a valid tic-tac-toe game state. That is, one of the players may have skipped some of their turns.</li>
</ul>

### 출력

<p>Output two space-separated integers representing the row and the column where the player should play. Note, the rows and columns are $1$-indexed, so if the player should play in the top left corner, then you should output "$1$ $1$".</p>
