### 문제 설명

<p>Star and Marco got themselves into a world where they are being attacked by swarms of numbers! Fortunately, the friends know what to do.</p>

<p>Each number is first served with a shot from Marco's binary blaster to expose the number's binary notation. After that, Star performs a power move one or more times: she reverses the binary notation of the number and then subtracts one. When the number becomes zero, it shatters to pieces.</p>

<p>The heroes have just entered the fight with a number $n$. How many power moves would it take to shatter this number to pieces?</p>

<p>Reversing works as follows: the first digit of the binary notation exchanges places with the last one, the second with the second-to-last, and so on. If leading zeroes appear in the result, they are discarded.</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$).</p>

### 출력

<p>Print a single integer: how many times would Star have to perform the power move so that the number $n$ becomes zero and shatters to pieces.</p>
