### 문제 설명

<p>You&rsquo;ve really messed up this time. &ldquo;Go buy some square tiles&rdquo; your supervisor told you. But as usual, you were either busy reading that message, answering that e-email, or updating your wall status on facebook. &ldquo;Go buy some tiles&rdquo; was all that you could remember. Your supervisor is now complaining that the tiles you bought were not squares and you&rsquo;ll be fired if you don&rsquo;t fix it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fix it? How am I supposed to fix it?&rdquo; you say to yourself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a programmer, The only tiles I know are those of the game Tetris!&rdquo; There is no way you can afford to be fired either. This is your third job in less than a month. &ldquo;I have to fix it!&rdquo; you keep repeating.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/upload/images2/tete1.png" style="float:right; height:133px; width:130px" />You call the store you bought the tiles from, but they won&rsquo;t take them back or even exchange. &ldquo;We cannot cancel orders once the merchandise has left the store&rdquo;, they tell you. You take a look at the tiles, they&rsquo;re all rectangle-shaped and all of the same size. You&rsquo;d be losing a lot if you cut them, not that you&rsquo;d be able to cut them into perfect squares in the first place. &ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; you say to yourself. You grab a bunch of tiles, put them in some arrangement and Voila, that&rsquo;s a square. But that won&rsquo;t convince your boss. Tiles are supposed to be small, and what you came-up with is rather big. You take another look at your arrangement, and it hits you again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on a roll today!&rdquo; you say proudly to yourself. You just figured out how to find the smallest number of tiles needed to form the smallest possible square.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/upload/images2/tete2.png" style="float:right; height:73px; width:69px" />You rush and bring your supervisor to show him your discovery. He&rsquo;s not that much impressed. You&rsquo;re not making sense anyway (given all the blood rushing in your head trying to explain your algorithm.) You know that the calculation is definitely much simpler than what you&rsquo;re saying, but you just can&rsquo;t seem to think clearly. Finally, your supervisor shouts: &ldquo;First of all, the tiles have to be laid-down in the same orientation. Second, I&rsquo;m running a construction site here, not a software shop! How do you expect the workers to figure out that number! You either write me a program to do the calculation you&rsquo;re describing, or you go collect your netbook, your cell, your ipod, and your blackberry, and you get out of here this minute!&rdquo;</p>

### 입력

<p>Your program will be tested on one or more data sets. Each test set is described on a single line made of two positive numbers: (0 &lt; W, H &lt; 1, 000, 000) which are the width and height of each tile. The last line is made of two zeros.</p>

### 출력

<p>For each test case, write the answer on a separate line.</p>
