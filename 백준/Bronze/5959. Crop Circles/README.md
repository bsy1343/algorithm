### 문제 설명

<p>Bessie and her fellow herd-mates have become extremely territorial. The N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 400) cows conveniently numbered 1..N have all staked out a grazing spot in the pasture. Each cow i has a spot on an integer grid (0 &lt;= X_i &lt;= 10,000; 0 &lt;= Y_i &lt;= 10,000) and an integer radius R_i that indicates the circle she is staking out (1 &lt;= R_i &lt;= 500).</p>

<p>The cows are a bit greedy and sometimes stake out territory of their herd-mates. For each cow, calculate the number of other cows whose territory overlaps her territory.</p>

<p>By way of example, consider these six cows with indicated locations and radii (don&#39;t confuse radius with diameter!):</p>

<p>By visual inspection, we can see and count the overlaps, as shown.</p>

<p>NOTE: the test data will avoid pathological situations like tangents where the circles just barely touch.</p>

### 입력

<ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer: N</li>
	<li>Lines 2..N+1: Three space-separated integers: X_i, Y_i, and R_i</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### 출력

<ul>
	<li>Lines 1..N: Line i contains a single integer that is the number of other fields that overlap with cow i&#39;s field.</li>
</ul>
