### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John has an old-time thresher (wheat harvester) that requires belts to be installed on various gears to turn the parts. The engine drives pulley 1 in a clockwise direction which attaches via a belt to pulley 2. Pulley 2 attaches via a belt to pulley 3 and so on through a total of N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1,000) pulleys (and N-1 belts).</p>

<p>The diagram above depicts the two ways a belt can be installed between two gears. In this illustration, pulley 1&#39;s belt directly drives pulley 2 (a &#39;straight&#39; connection) and thus they will rotate in the same direction. Pulley 3 drives pulley 4 via a &#39;crossed belt&#39; that reverses the direction of the rotation.</p>

<p>Given a list of the belt types that connect the pulleys along with the fact that pulley 1 is driven in a clockwise direction by the engine, determine the drive direction of pulley N. Each belt is described by three integers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>S_i -- the driving (source) pulley</li>
	<li>D_i -- the driven (destination) pulley</li>
	<li>C_i -- the connection type (0=straight, 1=crossed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, FJ lists the belts in random order.</p>

<p>By way of example, consider the illustration below. N = 4, and pulley 1 is driven clockwise by the thresher engine. Straight belts drive pulley 2 and then pulley 3, so they rotate clockwise. The crosswise belt reverses the rotation direction so pulley 4 (pulley N) rotates counterclockwise.</p>
