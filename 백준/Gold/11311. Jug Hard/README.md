### 문제 설명

<p>You have two empty jugs and tap that may be used to fill a jug. When filling a jug from the tap, you can only fill it completely (i.e., you cannot partially fill it to a desired level, since there are no volume measurements on the jug).</p>

<p>You may empty either jug at any point.</p>

<p>You may transfer water between the jugs: if transferring water from a larger jug to a smaller jug, the smaller jug will be full and there will be water left behind in the larger jug.</p>

<p>Given the volumes of the two jugs, is it possible to have one jug with some specific volume of water?</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line contains T, the number of test cases (1 &le; T 100 000). Each test case is composed of three integers: a b d where a and b (1 &le; a, b &le; 10 000 000) are the volumes of the two jugs, and d is the desired volume of water to be generated. You can assume that d &le; max(a,b).</p>

### 출력

<p>For each of the T test cases, output either Yes or No, depending on whether the specific volume of water can be placed in one of the two jugs.</p>
