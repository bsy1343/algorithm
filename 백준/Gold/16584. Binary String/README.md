### 문제 설명

<p>A binary string is a non-empty sequence of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s, e.g., 010110, 1, 11101, etc. Ayu has a favorite binary string S which contains no leading zeroes. She wants to convert S into its decimal representation with her calculator.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, her calculator cannot work on any integer larger than K and it will crash. Therefore, Ayu may need to remove zero or more bits from S while maintaining the order of the remaining bits such that its decimal representation is no larger than K. The resulting binary string also must not contain any leading zeroes.</p>

<p>Your task is to help Ayu to determine the minimum number of bits to be removed from S to satisfy Ayu&rsquo;s need.</p>

<p>For example, let S = 1100101 and K = 13. Note that 1100101 is 101 in decimal representation, thus, we need to remove several bits from S to make it no larger than K. We can remove the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup> most significant bits, i.e. 1100101 &rarr; 1101. The decimal representation of 1101 is 13, which is no larger than K = 13. In this example, we removed 3 bits, and this is the minimum possible (If we remove only 2 bits, then we will have a binary string of length 5 bits; notice that any binary string of length 5 bits has a value of at least 16 in decimal representation).</p>

### 입력

<p>Input begins with a line containing an integer K (1 &le; K &le; 2<sup>60</sup>) representing the limit of Ayu&rsquo;s calculator. The second line contains a binary string S (1 &le; |S| &le; 60) representing Ayu&rsquo;s favorite binary string. You may safely assume S contains no leading zeroes.</p>

### 출력

<p>Output contains an integer in a line representing the minimum number of bits to be removed from S.</p>
