### 문제 설명

<p>A distant planetary system has a single sun and N &minus; 1 planets. Each planet is identified by a distinct integer from 2 to N. In planet b, numbers are represented using base b.</p>

<p>A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are written both forward and backward. In this context, leading zeroes are not considered when determining if a number is palindromic.</p>

<p>The same number can be palindromic in one planet&rsquo;s base but not in another. For instance, in base 10, the number 33 is palindromic. It is also palindromic in base 2 and base 32 but not in bases such as 3 or 33, since 33<sub>10</sub> = 100001<sub>2</sub> = 1020<sub>3</sub> = 11<sub>32</sub> = 10<sub>33</sub>.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this planetary system have a peculiar fondness for palindromic numbers and want to know which planets make the number N a palindromic number when represented in their base. Your task is to help them with this cosmic challenge.</p>

### 입력

<p>The input consists of a single line that contains an integer N (2 &le; N &le; 10<sup>12</sup>) indicating the number to be checked for palindromic representation. N is given in base 10.</p>

### 출력

<p>Output a single line with an increasing list of integers in the interval [2, N], indicating the planets in which N is a palindromic number when expressed in the base of the planet&rsquo;s identifier. Output these integers in base 10. If N is not palindromic in any of the planets, output the character &ldquo;*&rdquo; (asterisk) instead.</p>
