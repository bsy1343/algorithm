### 문제 설명

<p>There are n lots on one side of a street (where n &le; 500). We would like to erect at most k apartment buildings on these lots. Each building must occupy an interval of at most t consecutive lots. Moreover, each lot i has a height restriction r[i] (where r[i] &le; 100). A building cannot exceed any of the height restriction of any lot on which it is built (that is, the maximal height of the building that can be erected on lot i to j is H = min{r[i], r[i + 1], ..., r[j]}). Hence, the maximum usable facade space of the building is H &times; (j &minus; i + 1). We would like to have a program to select at most k non-overlapping intervals to erect the buildings such that the total usable facade space is maximized.</p>

<p>Consider a street of length 10. The height restriction of each lot is as follows.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><code>7, 3, 12, 11, 13, 4, 8, 6, 6, 20</code></p>

<p>Suppose we would like to erect at most k = 2 buildings and each building occupies at most t = 4 lots. Then, to maximize the total usable facade space, we choose two intervals r[3..5] = (12, 11, 13) and r[7..10] = (8, 6, 6, 20) (see &ldquo;Example 1&rdquo; in the figure below). The maximum usable facade space is 3 &lowast; min{12, 11, 13} + 4 &lowast; min{8, 6, 6, 20} = 57.</p>

<p>Suppose we would like to erect at most k = 3 buildings on the same street with the same height restrictions as in Example 1, and each building occupies at most t = 4 lots. Then, to maximize the total usable facade space, we choose three intervals r[3..5] = (12, 11, 13), r[7..9] = (8, 6, 6) and r[10..10] = (20) (see &ldquo;Example 2&rdquo; in the figure above). The maximum usable facade space is 3 &lowast; min{12, 11, 13}+ 3 &lowast; min{8, 6, 6}+ 1 &lowast; 20 = 71.</p>

### 입력

<p>The input file is as follows. The first line contains three integers n, k, and t separated by a space character, where 1 &le; n &le; 500, 1 &le; k &le; n, and 1 &le; t &le; n. The rest of the n lines contain n positive integers representing the height restriction for the n lots.</p>

### 출력

<p>The output&nbsp;contains an integer which is the maximum usable facade space.</p>
