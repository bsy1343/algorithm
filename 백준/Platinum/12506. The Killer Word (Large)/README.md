### 문제 설명

<p>You are playing Hangman with your friend Sean. And while you have heard that Sean is very good at taking candy from a baby, he is not as good at this game. Can you take advantage of Sean&#39;s imperfect strategy, and make him lose as badly as possible?</p>

<pre>

+-+---+
</pre>

<p>Hangman is played as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There is a dictionary&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;of all valid words, which both you and Sean know. A word consists only of the characters&nbsp;<code>a</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<code>z</code>. In particular, there are no spaces.</li>
	<li>You begin by choosing any word from&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>, and writing it down on a blackboard with each letter replaced by a blank:&nbsp;<code>_</code>.</li>
	<li>On his turn, Sean can choose any letter and ask you if it is in the word. If it is, you reveal&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;locations of that letter. Otherwise, Sean loses a point.</li>
	<li>Once all letters in the word have been revealed, the round ends.</li>
	<li>The round never ends early, no matter how many points Sean loses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sean uses a very simple strategy. He makes a list&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>&nbsp;of the 26 letters in some order, and goes through the list one letter at a time. If there is at least one word in&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;that (a) has the letter he is thinking of, and (b) is consistent with what you have written down so far&nbsp;<em>and the result of all of Sean&#39;s previous guesses</em>, then Sean guesses that letter. Otherwise, he skips it. No matter what, Sean then moves on to the next letter in his list.</p>

<p>Given Sean&#39;s list, what word should you choose to make Sean lose as many as points as possible? If several choices are equally good, you should choose the one that appears first in&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Suppose Sean decides to guess the letters in alphabetical order (i.e.,&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>&nbsp;= &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;), and&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;contains the words&nbsp;<code>banana</code>,&nbsp;<code>caravan</code>, and<code>pajamas</code>. If you choose&nbsp;<code>pajamas</code>, the game would play out as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You begin by writing 7 blanks&nbsp;<code>_ _ _ _ _ _ _</code>&nbsp;on the blackboard. Based on the number of blanks, Sean knows immediately that the word is either&nbsp;<code>caravan</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>pajamas</code>.</li>
	<li>Sean begins by guessing&nbsp;<code>a</code>&nbsp;since it is first in&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>, and you reveal all locations of the letter&nbsp;<code>a</code>&nbsp;on the blackboard:&nbsp;<code>_ a _ a _ a _</code>.</li>
	<li>Sean skips&nbsp;<code>b</code>&nbsp;even though it is used in&nbsp;<code>banana</code>. Sean already knows that is not your word.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>He then guesses&nbsp;<code>c</code>&nbsp;because it appears in&nbsp;<code>caravan</code>. It does not appear in the word you actually chose though, so Sean loses a point and nothing more is revealed.</li>
	<li>By process of elimination, Sean now knows your word has to be&nbsp;<code>pajamas</code>, so he proceeds to guess&nbsp;<code>j</code>,&nbsp;<code>m</code>,&nbsp;<code>p</code>, and&nbsp;<code>s</code>&nbsp;in order, without losing any more points.</li>
</ul>

<p>So Sean loses one point if you choose&nbsp;<code>pajamas</code>. He would have gotten either of the other words without losing any points.</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>&nbsp;test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing integers&nbsp;<strong>N</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>, representing the number of words in the dictionary and the number of lists to consider.</p>

<p>The next&nbsp;<strong>N</strong>&nbsp;lines contain the words in the dictionary, one per line:&nbsp;<strong>D</strong><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<strong>D</strong><sub>2</sub>, ...,&nbsp;<strong>D<sub>N</sub></strong>. Each word is an arbitrary sequence of characters&nbsp;<code>a</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<code>z</code>.</p>

<p>The final&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>&nbsp;lines contain all of the lists Sean will use, one per line:&nbsp;<strong>L</strong><sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;<strong>L</strong><sub>2</sub>, ...,&nbsp;<strong>L<sub>M</sub></strong>. Each list is exactly 26 letters long, containing each letter exactly once. Sean will use these lists to guess letters as described above.</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<ul>
	<li>1 &le;&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>&nbsp;&le; 10.</li>
	<li>Each word in&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;will have between 1 and 10 characters inclusive.</li>
	<li>No two words in&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;will be the same within a single test case.</li>
	<li>1 &le;&nbsp;<strong>N</strong>&nbsp;&le; 10000.</li>
	<li>1 &le;&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>&nbsp;&le; 100.</li>
</ul>

### 출력

<p>For each test case, output one line containing &quot;Case #x:&nbsp;<strong>w</strong><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<strong>w</strong><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<strong>w</strong><sub><strong>M</strong></sub>&quot;, where x is the case number (starting from 1) and&nbsp;<strong>w</strong><sub>i</sub>&nbsp;is the word you should choose if Sean guesses the letters in order&nbsp;<strong>L</strong><sub>i</sub>. If multiple words cause Sean to lose the same number of points, you should choose the option that appears first in the dictionary.</p>
