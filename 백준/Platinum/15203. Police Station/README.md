### 문제 설명

<p>A network of hyperspace highways is built in the galaxy. Each of the highways&nbsp;is a one-directional corridor which connects two planets. Galactic government&nbsp;wants to find a planet on which a police station will be built.</p>

<p>In order for the police to protect the whole galaxy, it must be possible to&nbsp;travel from the police station to every planet in the galaxy using the&nbsp;hyperspace highways network.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that the police can return back to the police station from&nbsp;any planet using the hyperspace highways. The police needs not to hurry on the&nbsp;way back, and so they can use slower ways than highways.</p>

<p>The government does not know how to deal with finding the suitable planet for&nbsp;the police station; therefore, they ask for your help</p>

<p>You are given the network of one-directional hyperspace highways. Find all&nbsp;planets from which it is possible to reach all other planets in the galaxy using&nbsp;some sequence of highways.</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line of the input contains two integers $N$ a $M$: the number of&nbsp;planets and the number of highways.</p>

<p>Then, $M$ more lines follow. Each contains two integers $A_i$ and $B_i$: the&nbsp;numbers of planets connected by $i$-th highway. Each of the highways is&nbsp;one-directional and can only be used to travel from the planet $A_i$ to the&nbsp;planet $B_i$.</p>

<ul>
	<li>It holds $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^6$.</li>
	<li>For all $i$it holds $1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq N$ and $A_i \neq B_i$.</li>
	<li>No two highways connect equal planets in the same direction. However, they can&nbsp;connect equal planets in the opposite direction.</li>
	<li>Furthermore, in 30 % of the testcases $N \leq 10^3$ and $M \leq 3 \cdot 10^3$.</li>
</ul>

### 출력

<p>Output two lines. The first line should contain the total number of planets&nbsp;which are suitable for the police station. The second line should contain&nbsp;a space-separated list of these planets <strong>in ascending order</strong>.</p>
