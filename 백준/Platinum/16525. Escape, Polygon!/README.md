### 문제 설명

<p>A suspicious-looking convex polygon wants to escape its current position by translating itself along some straight-line direction. Three very diligent straight lines want to lock it up by placing themselves along three distinct sides of the polygon. Then, if the triple of lines defines a triangle and the polygon lies inside this triangle, it will be locked up. Otherwise, it will escape.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="%EB%B0%B1%EC%A4%80/Platinum/16525.%E2%80%85Escape%2C%E2%80%85Polygon!/685c493a.png" data-original-src="https://upload.acmicpc.net/1992a244-399f-486d-88aa-b57dd4d8017a/-/preview/" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src=this.dataset.originalSrc" style="width: 609px; height: 202px;" /></p>

<p>Figure (a) above illustrates a triple that will lock the polygon up. For (b), the lines do not define a triangle since two of them are parallel, and so the polygon will escape. In (c), the polygon lies outside the triangle defined by the triple and it will easily escape.</p>

<p>Given a polygon, you must compute the number of distinct triples of lines that can lock the polygon up.</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line contains an integer N (3 &le; N &le; 10<sup>5</sup>) representing the number of vertices of the polygon. Each of the next N lines describes a vertex with two integers X and Y (&minus;10<sup>8</sup> &le; X, Y &le; 10<sup>8</sup>) indicating the coordinates of the vertex in the XY plane. The vertices are given in counter-clockwise order and they define a simple convex polygon. No three vertices are collinear.</p>

### 출력

<p>Output a single line with an integer indicating the number of distinct triples of lines that can lock the given polygon up.</p>
