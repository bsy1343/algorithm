### 문제 설명

<p>A couple of years ago the Bergen Ministry of Infrastructure prepared a plan for a new light railway network. This network was supposed to connect all n neighbourhoods in the city with n&minus;1 railway tracks in such a way, that there would be a path from every neighbourhood to every other neighbourhood. The planned tracks are identified by numbers from 1 to n &minus; 1.</p>

<p>Years passed, new elections are approaching, and the railway network still exists only on paper. Therefore the Minister of Infrastructure (representing a party holding disagreement in high regard) decided to construct at least some part of the plan. He asked each of his m deputy ministers to choose which neighbourhoods they thought should be connected. That will result in a list of necessary tracks for each deputy minister. If a deputy minister thinks that the neighbourhoods a<sub>1</sub>, . . . , a<sub>s</sub> need to be connected, then according to him or her, the necessary tracks are all those which lie on planned paths from a<sub>i</sub> to a<sub>j</sub> for some 1 &le; i &lt; j &le; s.</p>

<p>The minister just received all lists from the deputy ministers. He decided to construct in the first place the tracks which are requested by at least k deputy ministers. Your task is to prepare a list of these tracks.</p>

### 입력

<p>In the first line of the input there are three integers n, m and k. The next n &minus; 1 lines contain the plan; in the i-th of these lines there are two integers a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub> (1 &le; a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> &le; n, a<sub>i</sub> &ne; b<sub>i</sub>), specifying that the i-th track on the plan is between neighbourhoods a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub>.</p>

<p>In the next m lines there are neighbourhoods chosen by deputy ministers; the i-th of these lines begins with an integer s<sub>i</sub> which specify the number of neighbourhoods chosen by the i-th deputy minister. After it there are s<sub>i</sub> integers specifying these neighbourhoods. The total length of all lists of deputy ministers is at most S, i.e. &sum;s<sub>i</sub> &le; S.</p>

### 출력

<p>In the first line of the output you should write one integer r, specifying the number of tracks which are requested by at least k deputy ministers. In the second line you should write r identifiers of these tracks in ascending order.</p>

### 제한

<p>We always have 2 &le; s<sub>i</sub> &le; n &le; 100 000, S &le; 100 000, and 1 &le; k &le; m &le; 50 000. For subcases, the inputs have these further restrictions.</p>

### 힌트

<p>The first deputy minister thinks that tracks 1&ndash;3, 2&ndash;3, 3&ndash;4 and 4&ndash;5 are necessary. The second deputy minister considers tracks 3&ndash;4 and 4&ndash;6, and the third one only track 2&ndash;3. Tracks 2&ndash;3 and 3&ndash;4 are necessary according to at least two deputy ministers.</p>
