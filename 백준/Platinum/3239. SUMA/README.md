### 문제 설명

<p>We can represent a 2D vector as a pair (X,Y).</p>

<p>The sum of two or more vectors is a vector whose coordinates are the sums of the corresponding coordinates of all the vectors in the sum.</p>

<p>e.g. (1,2)+(3,4)+(5,6) = (1+3+5,2+4+6) = (9,12)</p>

<p>Weight of a vector (x,y) is defined as x*x+y*y.</p>

<p>You are given N vectors on a plain.</p>

<p>Your task is to write a program that will determine a subset of those vectors so the weight of the sum of all vectors in that subset is maximal.</p>

<p>Note: Use 64-bit integers (int64 in pascal or long long in c)&nbsp;</p>

### 입력

<p>In the first line of the input file is an integer N, 1 &le; N &le; 30,000, the number of vectors.</p>

<p>The following N lines contain descriptions for each of the vectors.</p>

<p>A description is made of two integers X and Y, separated by a single blank, -30,000 &le; X,Y &le; 30,000.</p>

<p>None of the given vectors will be (0,0).&nbsp;</p>

### 출력

<p>In the first and only line of the output file you have to write the weight of the maximum sum.</p>
