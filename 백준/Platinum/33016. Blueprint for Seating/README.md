### 문제 설명

<p>An aircraft manufacturing company wants to optimize their products for passenger airlines. The company's latest research shows that most of the delays happen because of slow boarding.</p>

<p>Most of the medium-sized aircraft are designed with 3-3 seat layout, meaning each row has 6 seats: 3 seats on the left side, a single aisle, and 3 seats on the right side. At each of the left and right sides there is a window seat, a middle seat, and an aisle seat. A passenger that boards an aircraft assigned to an aisle seat takes significantly less time than a passenger assigned to a window seat even when there is no one else in the aircraft.</p>

<p>The company decided to compute an <em>inconvenience</em> of a layout as the total sum of distances from each of the seats of a single row to the closest aisle. The distance from a seat to an aisle is the number of seats between them. For a 3-3 layout, a window seat has a distance of 2, a middle seat --- 1, and an aisle seat --- 0. The inconvenience of a 3-3 layout is $(2+1+0)+(0+1+2)=6$. The inconvenience of a 3-5-3 layout is $(2+1+0)+(0+1+2+1+0)+(0+1+2)=10$.</p>

<p>Formally, a layout is a sequence of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{k+1}$ --- group $i$ having $a_i$ seats, with $k$ aisles between groups, the $i$-th aisle being between groups $i$ and $i+1$. This means that in a layout each aisle must always be between two seats, so no aisle can be next to a window, and no two aisles can be next to each other.</p>

<p>The company decided to design a layout with a row of $n$ seats, $k$ aisles and having the minimum inconvenience possible. Help them find the minimum inconvenience among all layouts of $n$ seats and $k$ aisles, and count the number of such layouts modulo $998\,244\,353$.% Two layouts are different if their corresponding sequences are different.</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line contains an integer $t$ --- the number of test cases you need to solve ($1 \le t \le 10^5$).</p>

<p>For each of the test cases, there is a single line containing $n$ and $k$ --- the number of seats, and the number of aisles in a row ($2 \le n \le 10^9$; $1 \le k \le 10^5$; $k &lt; n$).</p>

<p>The total sum of $k$ in all $t$ given test cases does not exceed $10^6$.</p>

### 출력

<p>For each test case print two integers --- the minimum inconvenience among all possible layouts, and the number of layouts with the minimum inconvenience modulo $998\,244\,353$.</p>

### 힌트

<p>In the last test case of <code>9 2</code> the possible layouts with the minimum inconvenience of 6 are 3-4-2, 2-4-3, and 2-5-2.</p>
