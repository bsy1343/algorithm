### 문제 설명

<p>For an array $b=[b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m]$ of length $m$ ($b_i \geq 2$), consider the following two-player game played by Poby and Rekkles.</p>

<ul>
<li>The players take turns, with Poby moving first.</li>
<li>On Poby's turn, he must choose an element $x \ge 2$ and replace it with $\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor$. In other words, he picks $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq m$) such that $b_i \ge 2$, then does $b_i := \left\lfloor \frac{b_i}{2} \right\rfloor$.</li>
<li>On Rekkles' turn, he must choose an element $x \ge 2$ from the array $b$ and replace it with $x+1$. In other words, he picks $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq m$) such that $b_i \ge 2$, then does $b_i := b_i+1$.</li>
</ul>

<p>The game ends once all elements in the array $b$ are equal to $1$.</p>

<p>Define the <strong>score</strong> of the game as the number of moves that Poby makes. Poby's goal is to minimize the <strong>score</strong>, while Rekkles's goal is to maximize the <strong>score</strong>.</p>

<p>Then, the <strong>value</strong> of the array $b$ is the score of the game when both players play optimally.</p>

<p>You are given an integer array $a$ of length $n$ ($a_i \ge 2$).</p>

<p>Answer $q$ independent queries. In each query, you are given a range $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$ and must find the <strong>value</strong> of the array $[a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r]$.</p>

### 입력

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.</p>

<p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, q \le 250\,000$) --- the length of the array and the number of queries.</p>

<p>The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($2 \le a_i \le 10^9$) --- the elements of the array $a$.</p>

<p>Then $q$ lines follow. The $j$-th of them contains two integers $l_j$ and $r_j$ ($1 \le l_j \le r_j \le n$) --- the range of the subarray for the $i$-th query.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $250\,000$.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $250\,000$.</p>

### 출력

<p>For each test case, output $q$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain a single integer representing the answer to the $i$-th query.</p>

### 힌트

<p><strong>Explanation of the first test case, first query (1 1):</strong></p>

<p>The subarray is $[4]$.</p>

<ol>
<li>Poby: $4\to \left\lfloor \tfrac{4}{2}\right\rfloor=2$. The array is $[2]$.</li>
<li>Rekkles: $2\to 3$. The array is $[3]$.</li>
<li>Poby: $3\to \left\lfloor \tfrac{3}{2}\right\rfloor=1$. The array is $[1]$, so the game ends.</li>
</ol>

<p>It can be shown that this strategy is optimal for both players. Therefore, the value of the array $[4]$ is $2$.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation of the first test case, second query (1 2):</strong></p>

<p>The subarray is $[4,3]$.</p>

<ol>
<li>Poby: $3\to \left\lfloor \tfrac{3}{2}\right\rfloor=1$. The array is $[4,1]$.</li>
<li>Rekkles: $4\to 5$. The array is $[5,1]$.</li>
<li>Poby: $5\to \left\lfloor \tfrac{5}{2}\right\rfloor=2$. The array is $[2,1]$.</li>
<li>Rekkles: $2\to 3$. The array is $[3,1]$.</li>
<li>Poby: $3\to \left\lfloor \tfrac{3}{2}\right\rfloor=1$. The array is $[1,1]$, so the game ends.</li>
</ol>

<p>It can be shown that this strategy is optimal for both players. Therefore, the value of the array $[4,3]$ is $3$.</p>
