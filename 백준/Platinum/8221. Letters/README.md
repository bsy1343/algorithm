### 문제 설명

<p>Little Johnny has a very long surname. Yet he is not the only such person in his milieu. As it turns out, one of his friends from kindergarten, Mary, has a surname of the same length, though different from Johnny&#39;s. Moreover, their surnames contain precisely the same number of letters of each kind - the same number of letters A, same of letters B, and so on.</p>

<p>Johnny and Mary took to one another and now often play together. One of their favourite games is to gather a large number of small pieces of paper, write successive letters of Johnny&#39;s surname on them, and then shift them so that they obtain Mary&#39;s surname in the end.</p>

<p>Since Johnny loves puzzles, he has begun to wonder how many swaps of adjacent letters are necessary to turn his surname into Mary&#39;s. For a child his age, answering such question is a formidable task. Therefore, soon he has asked you, the most skilled programmer in the kindergarten, to write a program that will help him.</p>

### 입력

<p>In the first line of the standard input there is a single integer n (2 &le; n &le; 1,000,000) denoting the length of Johnny&#39;s surname. The second line contains Johnny&#39;s surname itself, i.e., contains its n successive letters (without spaces). The third line contains Mary&#39;s surname in the same format: a string of n letters (with no spaces either). Both strings consist only of capital (upper-case) letters of the English alphabet.</p>

### 출력

<p>Your program should print a single integer to the standard output: the minimum number of swaps of adjacent letters that transforms Johnny&#39;s surname into Mary&#39;s.</p>
