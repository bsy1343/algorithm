### 문제 설명

<p>Division game is a 2-player game. In this game, there is a matrix of positive integers with N rows and M columns. Players make their moves in turns. In each step, the current player selects a row. If the row contains all 1s, the player looses. Otherwise, the player can select any number of integers (but at least 1 and each of them should be greater than 1) from that row and then divides each of the selected integers with any divisor other than 1. For example, 6 can be divided by 2, 3 and 6, but cannot be divided by 1, 4 and 5. The player who first makes the matrix all 1s wins. In other words, if in his/her move, player gets the matrix with all 1s, then he/she looses. Given the matrix, your task is to determine whether the first player wins or not. Assume that both of the players will play perfectly to win.&nbsp;</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line has a positive integer T, T &lt;= 100,000, denoting the number of test cases. This is followed by each test case per line. Each test case starts with a line containing 2 integers N and M representing the number of rows and columns respectively. Both N and M are between 1 and 50 inclusive. Each of the next N line each contains M integers. All these integers are between 2 and 10000 inclusive.</p>

### 출력

<p>For each test case, the output contains a line in the format Case #x: M, where x is the case number (starting from 1) and M is &ldquo;YES&rdquo; when the first player has a winning strategy and &ldquo;NO&rdquo; otherwise.</p>
