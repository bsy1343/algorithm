<p>A word cloud (or tag cloud) is a visual representation of textual data based on a weighted metric. In the above cloud (which is based on this year&#39;s list of Mid-Central teams), the font size of each word is based on its number of occurrences in the data set. Tagg Johnson is a man obsessed with counting words that appear in online documents. On his computer, he keeps a spreadsheet of all the sites he visits, along with a list of words that appear on each site and the number of times such word appears. Tagg would like to generate word clouds based on the data he has collected.</p>

<p>Before describing the algorithm Tagg uses for generating clouds, we digress for a quick lesson in typography. The basic unit of measure is known as a <em>point</em> (typically abbreviated as <em>pt</em>). A font&#39;s size is described based on the vertical number of points from one line to the next, including any interline spacing. For example, with a 12pt font, the vertical space from the top of one character to the top of a character below it is 12 points. We assume that a character&#39;s height is precisely equal to the font&#39;s point size (regardless of whether the character is upper or lower case).</p>

<p>For this problem, we focus on a fixed-width font, such as Courier, in which each character of the alphabet is also given the same amount of width. The character width for such a font depends on the font size and the aspect ratio. For Courier, a word with <em>t</em> characters rendered in a font of size <em>P</em> has a total width of \(\left\lceil \frac{9}{16} \cdot t \cdot P \right\rceil\) when measured in points. Note well the use of the ceiling operator, which converts any noninteger to the next highest integer. For example, a 5-letter word in a 20pt font would be rendered with a height of 20 points and a width equal to \(\left\lceil \frac{900}{16} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 56.25 \right\rceil = 57\) points.</p>

<p>Now we can describe Tagg&#39;s algorithm for creating a word cloud. He pre-sorts his word list into alphabetical order and removes words that do not occur at least five times. For each word&nbsp;<em>w</em>, he computes a point size based on the formula \(P = 8 + \left\lceil \frac{40(c_w - 4)}{(c_{max}-4)} \right\rceil\), where \(c_w\) is the number of occurrences of the word, and \(c_{max}\) is the number of occurrences of the most frequent word in the data set. Note that by this formula, every word will be rendered with anywhere from a 9pt font to a 48pt font. He then places the words in rows, with a 10pt horizontal space between adjacent words, placing as many words as fit in the row, subject to a maximum width&nbsp;<em>W</em> for his entire cloud. The height of a given row is equal to the <em>maximum</em> font size of any word rendered in that row.</p>

<p>As a tangible example, consider the following data set and word cloud.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>word</strong></td>
			<td><strong>count</strong></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

<p>In this example, <code>apple</code> is rendered with 23pt font using width&nbsp;65pt, <code>banana</code> is rendered with 11pt font using width&nbsp;38pt, and <code>grape</code> is rendered with 48pt font and width&nbsp;135pt. If the overall word cloud is constrained to have width at most 260, those three words fit in a row and the overall height of that row is 48pt (due to <code>grape</code>). On the second row <code>kiwi</code> is rendered with height 43pt and width 97pt, and <code>orange</code> is rendered with height 28pt and width 95pt. A third row has <code>strawberry</code> with height 23pt and width 130pt. The overall height of this word cloud is 114pt.</p>

### 입력

<p>Each data set begins with a line containing two integers: <em>W</em> and <em>N</em>. The value <em>W</em> denotes the maximum width of the cloud; <em>W</em> &le; 5000 will be at least as wide as any word at its desired font size. The value 1 &le; <em>N</em> &le; 100 denotes the number of words that appear in the cloud. Following the first line are <em>N</em> additional lines, each having a string <em>S</em> that is the word (with no whitespace), and an integer <em>C</em> that is a count of the number of occurrences of that word in the original data set, with 5 &le; <em>C</em> &le; 1000. Words will be given in the same order that they are to be displayed within the cloud.</p>

### 출력

<p>For each data set, output the word <kbd>CLOUD</kbd> followed by a space, a serial number indicating the data set, a colon, another space, and the integer height of the cloud, measured in font points.</p>
