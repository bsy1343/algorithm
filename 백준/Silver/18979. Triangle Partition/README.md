### 문제 설명

<p>Chiaki has $3n$ points $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_{3n}$. It is guaranteed that no three points are collinear.</p>

<p>Chiaki would like to construct $n$ disjoint triangles where each vertex comes from the $3n$ points.</p>

### 입력

<p>There are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:</p>

<p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) -- the number of triangle to construct.</p>

<p>Each of the next $3n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($-10^9 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^9$).</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $10^4$.</p>

### 출력

<p>For each test case, output $n$ lines contain three integers $a_i,b_i,c_i$ ($1 \le a_i,b_i,c_i \le 3n$) each denoting the indices of points the $i$-th triangle use. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.</p>
