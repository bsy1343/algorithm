### 문제 설명

<p>A new TV set, besides the regular capability to directly select a channel with the remote control, is equipped with the new &quot;turbo&quot; mode with an associated key (labeled with the letter T) on the remote control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turbo mode makes it easier to cycle through a number of previously selected channels. For usual operation, the user selects a channel by pressing the appropriate key on the remote control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let the currently displayed channel be channel X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After pressing the T key, the TV set enters the turbo mode, and changes to the first channel displayed after the last change to channel X. Additional presses of the T key make the TV set cycle through channels that were displayed between the two appearances of the channel X, channel X included. In one cycle, the TV set displays each channel only once, in order of their first appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the first appearance of the channel X is just before entering the turbo mode, the cycle starts with the first selected channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The TV set leaves the turbo mode when the user manually selects a channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, if the pressed keys are 1, 2, 3, T, T, T, T, T, 2, 4, 1, T, T, T and T:&nbsp;</p>
