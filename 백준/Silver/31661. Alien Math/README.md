### 문제 설명

<p>Humans are exploring the stars, and we have encountered aliens! In an exchange of scientific knowledge, we&rsquo;ve learned that not only do they use entirely different symbols to do math, they don&rsquo;t even use base ten! It would be nice to have a program to convert the alien numbers to decimal.</p>

<p>Shockingly, the aliens represent each of their digits with what might be multiple ascii characters. For example, <code>aba</code> might be a single digit for the alien&rsquo;s numerical system.</p>

<p>Given the base of their number system, an ordered list of all their system&rsquo;s digits, and a number $X$, convert $X$ to base $10$ and print it without any leading zeros.</p>

<p>For a quick refresher on number systems, a number system with base $B$ has $B$ digits that represent the values $0$ through $B-1$. For example, an alien number system with base $3$ could have digits <code>zork</code>, <code>ooble</code>, and <code>trzap</code> representing the values $0$, $1$, and $2$ respectively. The alien number <code>trzapzorkooble</code>, when written in standard decimal notation, is just $2 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 19$.</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line of input will consist of a single integer $B$ ($2 \leq B \leq 10^3$) indicating the number of digits used in the alien number system.</p>

<p>The next line consists of $B$ strings $D_0, D_1, \ldots , D_{B-1}$ with a single space between each string. These represent the digits in the alien number system, namely string $D_ i$ is the digit with value $i$. Each digit string $D_ i$ will consist of at least one and at most $10$ characters and will only contain lowercase letters (i.e. <code>a</code> through <code>z</code>).</p>

<p>The third line contains a single string $X$ consisting of at least $1$ and at most $300$ characters. This string represents a number written in the alien number system. The value of this number, in decimal, is at most $10^9$. It may be written with leading zeros in the alien number system. You are guaranteed that $X$ is the concatenation of digits from the alien number system (i.e. it is a valid number in their system).</p>

<p>Oh, and this is important. The aliens knew their system was a bit complicated, so to make it easier to read, they designed their number system so that the strings representing distinct digits do not have one being a prefix of the other. That is, $D_ i$ is not a prefix of $D_ j$ for any indices $i \neq j$.</p>

### 출력

<p>Print the value of $X$ in standard base $10$ notation without any leading zeros.</p>
