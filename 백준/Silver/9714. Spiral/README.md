### 문제 설명

<p>Consider all positive integers written in the following manner (you can imagine an infinite spiral).</p>

<pre>
21  22  23  24  25  26
20   7   8   9  10 ...
19   6   1   2  11 ...
18   5   4   3  12 ...
17  16  15  14  13 ...</pre>

<p>Your task is to determine the position (row,column) of a given number N, assuming that the center (number 1) has position (0,0). Rows are numbered from top to bottom, columns are numbered from left to right (for example, number 3 is at (1,1). Your program should output a string containing the position of N in the form (R,C) where R is the row and C is the column. R and C must not contain any leading zeroes.</p>

### 입력

<p>The first line of the input gives an integer T, which is the number of test cases. &nbsp;Each test case contains an integer N (1 &le; N&lt;2<sup>31</sup>).</p>

### 출력

<p>For each test case, output the position as described above. See sample output for further clarification. &nbsp;</p>
